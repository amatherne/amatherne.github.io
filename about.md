  content: 'My name is Austin Matherne, and I unapologetically sprung from the mid-80’s.
    I grew up in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, but have been a resident of the Austin area
    for the past decade. The laid back, laissez-faire style of the city reminded me
    of comforts of home, but embodied more of the cultural progressive attitudes that
    I value. This is why I want to give back, to give voice and presence to the local
    community of small business and artists that make Austin thrive.<br><br>For the
    past fifteen years I’ve been involved in the DIY punk music scene; booking my
    own tours, and playing shows all over the country. For last five years I’ve been
    a member of the local pedicab community, managing shops, overseeing ad campaigns,
    and coordinating 100+ riders at events, in and out of state. Before making my
    living on a tricycle, I spent three years at the Music Lab Rehearsal and Recording
    Studios. There, I built and managed two cafes that served both International and
    Local acts as they rehearsed.<br><br>Looking for a career that would emphasize
    creativity and utilize my problem solving skills, I was drawn to web design. I
    had dabbled in middle and high school by building my own websites and teaching
    myself basic HTML and CSS (see also: Myspace Themes). I enrolled in the web design
    bootcamp at the Iron Yard in Austin. There I learned how to properly apply design
    techniques, typography, and how to mesh them into the digital world appropriately
    with an aesthetic eye. They also taught me to identify problems and create solutions
    with a focus on the customer’s best interests. I am actively looking for projects
    that represent the diverse, eclectic community I’m a part of.'
